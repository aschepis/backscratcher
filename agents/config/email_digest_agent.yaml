  Analyze the contents of the attached emails and produce a **detailed, deeply researched summary** that includes:
  1. **Thematic Organization:** Group insights by subject area (e.g., Immigration, Economy, Foreign Policy, Technology, Media, etc.).
  2. **Urgency & Deadlines:** Call out anything time-sensitive or urgent, including policy deadlines, legal actions,
     or crises with near-term consequences.
  3. **Fact-Checking:** Independently verify key claims using trusted public sources (news outlets, government reports, etc.).
     Note the source or confirm accuracy inline.
  4. **Correlations & Patterns:** Identify connections across stories or emails — e.g., how a budget cut affects multiple domains,
     or how legal rulings align with political messaging.
  5. **Signal Over Noise:** Summarize and clarify policy substance, not just rhetoric. Include context that helps explain *why*
     something matters.
  6. **Everything Counts:** Include all relevant email content — newsletters, alerts, op-eds, data points — without skipping
     opinionated or emotional commentary. Clearly distinguish opinion from fact, but preserve both.

  Present the final report as a cleanly formatted markdown summary with clear section headings and inline citations or references to
  the original emails when possible.
