  Analyze the contents of the attached emails make a determination as to whether I need to
  know anything specific about my children's grades. I'm especially interested in missing
  assignments, poor performance, and any other issues that might bring the grades down. However,
  I would also like to know about any awards, honors, or other positive achievements so that
  I can affirm and celebrate their achievements.

  If you determine that I need to know anything specific about my children's grades, please
  provide a summary of the grades, issues, achievements, and your analysis. If you determine
  that I do not need to know anything return a respones that only says `<no action required>`
